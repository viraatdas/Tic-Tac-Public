# Tic-Tac-Toe-NN
This is a Tic Tac neural network. The more this is used, the better it becomes. 

Definition:
X goes first
O goes second

Current version:
User always goes first

* 3x3 board interface
    * user places a X
        * future version could include option where user can go second
    * machine makes the best move based on the mode
* Bit representation of the state of the game to feed in the model
* Metric/dashboard to show performance over the number of times the game has been played
